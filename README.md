Hello.
This is project which show Symbols statistics in Text.



It contains of script "praktyka.py"(main file where all code is placed), subdirectories generated by pyinstaller :
  1.build
  2.dist



Used modules and versions:
  - python '2.7.12'
  - PyQt4 '4.11.4'
  - matplotlib '1.5.1'

for building, please, use pyinstaller(for each platform it must be build separately).

To get this from git hub, use:
  1. clone from https://github.com/Varian72/prak
  2. install modules (describe Above) via pip or other tools
  3. Have fun:
    a. To develop go to directory, than use python(check if this command run right version (python --version))
      "python praktyka.py"
    b. To execute as a user, go to ./dist and run "praktyka.exe"













All code contains in "praktyka.py". I wanted to split code and move math in separate class, filling table and building charts in separate class but I'll make it step by step
so...
Have fun with it :(
